### Learnings

1. **Social Media Platform Development:** Building Travel-Nepal provided valuable experience in developing a social media platform from scratch. Understanding the intricacies of user profiles, posts, comments, and interactions was a significant learning curve.

2. **User-Generated Content Management:** Managing user-generated content, including posts, comments, and user profiles, taught the importance of data validation, security, and moderation to ensure a positive user experience.

3. **Community Building:** Creating a platform that fosters a sense of community among trek and hike enthusiasts involved learning how to design features that encourage user engagement and interaction.

4. **Geolocation and Mapping Integration:** Incorporating location-based features, such as searching for trekking locations and adding new places, required understanding geolocation and mapping technologies.

5. **Up-to-Date Information:** Providing real-time information on the suitability of trekking locations was a complex task that taught the importance of data accuracy, retrieval, and presentation.

6. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering(CSR) with Next.js:** Using Next.js allowed us to explore server-side rendering and client-side rendering, which significantly improved the performance and SEO of the application. Understanding SSR and CSR were crucial for delivering a fast and SEO-friendly website.

7. **Database Management with MongoDB:** Working with MongoDB as the database helped dive deep into NoSQL databases and their benefits for storing user data, posts, and location information.

8. **Backend Development:** Developing the backend using Node.js involved creating RESTful APIs, handling user authentication, and managing data retrieval and storage. It enhanced our understanding of backend development.

9. **User Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing user authentication securely, including features like Google sign-in, helped grasp the importance of protecting user data and managing user sessions.

10. **Project Planning and Prioritization:** Assembling and executing a project of this scale required effective project planning, task prioritization, and time management skills.
